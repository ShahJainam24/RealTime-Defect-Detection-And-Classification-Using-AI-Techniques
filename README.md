Visual inspection of an object by a person, in most cases not possible because of the error in eyesight and precision to recognize an object properly. In recent times, only video monitors and video recorders have been used where a person can check on-line or taped video sequences for defects. In this way, only small parts of an object i.e. top or bottom side are viewed.

Additionally, this visual inspection is subjective and dependent on a large number of human factors such as the problems of working longer hours, attention being drawn to other events, subjectivity in terms of defect severity assessment. Developing automatic detection and classification of surface defects of objects has been really a challenging problem. An automatic detection and classification system require knowledge of data concerning the current state of the objects, and a methodology to integrate various types of information into decision-making process of evaluating the quality of the product. The need for surface detection technologies for surface defect classification has long been recognized. Real time image processing typically involves the application of high-speed camera, which may give the defect images in real time. The large amount of information is gathered during this process in the form of images. Human experts evaluate this information and give the level of defects, types of defects of the objects. 

The main focus of this project is to utilize the perfect image of an object with proper dimensions and make effective use of this data in the development of successful application using various new technologies.
